My name is Fred. I am a chef and a student at the University of Auckland. I'm studying Marketing and Psychology. I'm in my third year. As for cooking, my favourite thing to cook is chicken noodle soup from scratch - at the moment. It changes fortnightly. I enjoy playing video games, working out and hanging with friends.

I decided to study at the University of Auckland because I wanted to come back to my home country to study and this University is said to be the best in the country. Most of my friends went here also.
