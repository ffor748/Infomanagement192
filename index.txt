My name is Fred. I am a chef and a student at the University of Auckland. I'm studying Marketing and Psychology. I'm in my third year. As for cooking, my favourite thing to cook is chicken noodle soup from scratch - at the moment. It changes fortnightly. I enjoy playing video games, working out and hanging with friends.
